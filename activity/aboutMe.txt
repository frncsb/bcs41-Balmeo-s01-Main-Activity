About Me
My name is John Francis Balmeo. I am 21 years old, and one day I aspire to be a Software Engineer, a QA Engineer, a Frontend developer, or a Game Developer. Honestly, I don't know yet. But I want to explore the field of computer science. I love to deal with problem-solving, and someday to be in the tech industry to use my computing skills to help the people around me. Today, I am a senior college student at De La Salle University Dasmarinas, and my goal is to do my best in everything.
My motivation for joining this class is to find my joy in computer science. I lost my fire in programming after being too complacent with my studies. And I want to use this opportunity to regain that fire and fall in love with programming again, whether in game development or computer science in general.
