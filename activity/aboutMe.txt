About Me
My name is John Francis Balmeo. I am 21 years old, and one day I aspire to be a Software Engineer, a QA Engineer, a Frontend developer, or a Game Developer. Honestly, I don't know yet. But I want to explore the field of computer science. I love to deal with problem-solving, and someday to be in the tech industry to use my computing skills to help the people around me. Today, I am a senior college student at De La Salle University Dasmarinas, and my goal is to do my best in everything.
My motivation for joining this class is to find my joy in computer science. I lost my fire in programming after being too complacent with my studies. And I want to use this opportunity to regain that fire and fall in love with programming again, whether in game development or computer science in general.
My work experience as a student involves the following: During my first year in college, I completed a UI/UX and GUI Phone Ordering App using Swift programming. It involved re-designing the Starbucks interface and adding a simple order tracker and receipt output. In my second year, we finished another simple ordering system GUI, fraction calculators, and a time and date tracker GUI using Java. For UI/UX, we designed a music app using Figma. In my third year, we completed a JavaScript platformer game, and using Unity 3D, we accomplished an endless wave RPG. 
And for the thesis, we're continuing to develop an Interactive Narrative Game with the Story focusing on Family, Friends, and Oneself. For Automata, we created a Java application that converts Regular Expressions to Context Free Grammar, Deterministic Finite Automata, Push Down Automata and allows the simulation of the current state to the final.
Currently, my work experience involves being a QA Analyst, where my job is to check and maintain the quality of systems in mobile and web development.
